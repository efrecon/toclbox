# ToclBox

ToclBox, a play on ToolBox and Tcl, contains an abstraction of the common code
between the utility libraries that have been written and used as part of
[concocter](https://github.com/efrecon/concocter) and
[biot](https://bitbucket.org/enbygg3/biot). This is a work in progress and
shouldn't be considered as stable or production-ready code.
